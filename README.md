My solution for CS50's Week 9 Problem Set

This web application was developed by me while I was working through the OpenCourseWare of CS50 (Introduction to Computer Science) at Harvard University. 

In Week 9, the Problem Set was to create the so-called 'C$50 Finance' web app, which can manage "imaginary" portfolios of stocks, including quoting, "buying" and "selling" real stocks with real, actual prices. You can read about the complete specification here:

This app is built with technologies like Python, Flask, sqlite3, Jinja, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
